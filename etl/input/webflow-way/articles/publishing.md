## Benefits of Webflow publishing

**Controlled publishes:**Manage site changes with staging environments before going live. Anything that’s not in a page branch will be published and go live.**Granular publishing**: Publish specific CMS content or the entire site as needed.**Fast deployment:**Updates go live instantly without requiring manual coordination with external hosting services.******Rollback safety:**Quickly revert to previous versions with backup/restore if needed.

## When to publish

**After publishing to staging:**It’s important to review and test site updates in your staging subdomain before publishing to a live domain.**Launching a new website:**Making a site publicly accessible for the first time.**Updating live content:**Publishing new blog posts, landing pages, or design refinements.**Deploying major redesigns**: Releasing large-scale layout or branding updates.

### CMS item publishing

For marketing teams that are making changes to CMS items, we recommend them to publish those individually in the CMS.

### Enterprise publishing workflow

Enterprises have additional detail in their publishing view with a summary of changes and who made them and the ability to click into specific changes, which takes them to the Site Activity Log.

### Unpublishing a site or page

We generally don’t recommend unpublishing a site unless it is being end-of-lifed / deprecated.
