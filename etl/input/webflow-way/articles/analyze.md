## Start with a weekly review of visitor behavior

The first step to becoming more data-driven is to build a sense of how visitors actually engage with your site. Many teams start with a fast, lightweight ritual like reviewing weekly site traffic and performance.

Questions to ask

How you might apply this during the week

# of Sessions or Unique Visitors received per day over the past week.

Did traffic go up or down, or is it flat? What are “quiet,” low traffic days of the week vs. busy, high-traffic days of the week?

You start to build a sense for what’s a busy vs. a quiet day, and what are typical fluctuations in traffic vs. what is a major spike/dip in traffic.

What are the most visited pages in the past week? What content is driving the most traffic?

Review the content/layout of the most popular pages. Are they up to date, accurate, as strong as they could be? Do they deserve a refresh?


Share standout pages with your team. Does it spark ideas about what content or design attracts visitor attention?

If you’re experiencing a spike in traffic on a certain page, dig into its page level performance (step 2).

What audience demographics (country, language, etc.) are most common in the past week? What devices are most common for your visitors?

Review key pages through the lens of popular languages and devices. How does the page look? Is it up to date, accurate, as strong as it could be? Do they deserve a refresh?

## Understand page performance

### View your site the way your visitors do

Not all pages perform equally! Page-level analysis gives you a visitor’s eye view of where people are engaging, where they lose interest, and how your content is really landing. It’s not just about grading your work or honing in on why there are more clicks on one element over another. It’s about zooming out to assess the page from the visitor’s view to identify opportunities to make your site more engaging.

Start by opening up a page in Analyze Mode, to see visitor behavior side by side and overlaid on top of your data. This could be one of your most popular pages, a page you recently redesigned, or a page you’re looking to improve.

Questions to ask

How you might apply this during the week

Like bounce rate (% of visitors who left without clicking on anything or visiting another page) and average time on page

Is this page holding our visitors attention? Are people visiting this page, and are they staying and engaging?

Prioritize which pages should get a refresh to reduce bounce rate. Flag high engagement pages as candidates for future improvements

Average page fold tracks a typical “first impression” for your page: what visitors see when they first land. Scroll depth tracks how far down the page your visitors get, and what content they end up seeing.

- Is the “first impression” of this page engaging? How does that vary by device type?
- Do visitors scroll as far down the page as you expect them to? Where are big drop off moments?
- Are visitors seeing the content that you think is most important, like CTAs or key information?

Identify what pages might be candidates for redesigns. This could include breaking up walls of text, simplifying layout, shortening long pages, or redesigning CTAs.

And common next page after viewing this page.

- Based on what gets the most clicks, what do your visitors think is the most interesting thing on the page?
- Based on the most common “next pages,” what content are visitors most interested in next?
- Is this layout guiding people to the next step you want them to take?

- Update layout, content, and design based on this POV.
- Imagine X is the most-clicked element on the page.
- If you want to make it easier for more users to see X CTA, how could you make X more prominent or more appealing?
- If you want visitors to instead click on Y more often, how could you tweak X to make it less prominent, or make Y more appealing?

What pages are those visitors most likely coming from?

- Update layout and content based on this POV.
- Put yourself in your visitors’ shoes.
- If you were arriving at this page, with the context of the most common previous pages, what questions might you have? What would you be hoping to see? Does this page reflect that and make that information easy to find?

**When to use this analysis: **

- After publishing new landing pages or high-stakes content
- Before deciding to invest in a page redesign or copy update.
- Set up a monthly “hero page” review where you assess top visited pages with fresh eyes.
- When overall site performance dips or changes, and you need to pinpoint why.

## Define and measure key actions

Once you know where visitors are spending time, the next step is defining the actions that matter, like form submissions, button clicks, or content engagement. Setting goals helps you measure what’s working, track progress, and focus your efforts on what drives real impact.

### Conversion goals

Start by identifying the key actions that you want your website visitors to take. These actions, which directly contribute to your website's success and revenue generation, are known as conversions.

This could involve visitors filling out a form with their contact information, signifying their interest in your product or service.

The ultimate goal for many websites is to drive sales and have visitors complete a purchase.

For content-driven websites, a key goal might be to have visitors view specific pages, indicating engagement with your content.

By defining these key actions as goals, you can track their performance and optimize your website to increase conversions.

### Learning goals

Beyond conversion goals, there are also actions that you might be curious about. These could include:

Tracking how visitors interact with specific features can provide insights into their effectiveness and potential areas for improvement.

Monitoring metrics like time on page, bounce rate, and click-through rates can help you understand how engaged visitors are with your content.

While these actions might not directly lead to conversions, they can provide valuable information that can help you refine your website and improve the overall user experience. By defining these actions as goals, you can track them over time and identify opportunities for optimization.

Defining clear goals is essential for measuring your website's success and making informed decisions about its design and functionality. By tracking both conversion and curiosity goals, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of how visitors interact with your website and optimize it to achieve your business objectives.

The Analyze Site overview gives offers a dashboard experience of how your site is performing according to various goals.

### Use your goals to assess your site

Once you’ve defined your site’s conversion goals and learning goals, here are some other questions to consider:

Questions to ask

How you might apply this

- Are visitors performing these goals? What % of visitors tend to perform these goals
- Which goals are more common or less common?

- Readjust conversion goals
- Define new conversions to track new interactions as your site evolves.

- What pages or traffic sources tend to drive conversions? Meaning: many conversions happen on this page, or a high rate of visitors to this page convert.
- What differentiates these pages or sources? What about the page design might make it convert well?

These are your strong pages or sources, which means something about these pages or sources are working well. You can:


- Drive more traffic to these pages or from these sources because it may result in more conversions.
- Learn from these pages or sources - what do these pages or sources do well that you can apply to other pages or sources?

- What pages or traffic sources are under-performing? Meaning: these sources drive a lot of traffic or a lot of visitors visit these pages, but conversion rates are low.
- What differentiates these pages or sources? What about the page design makes it convert poorly? Are CTAs visible, clear, and targeted?

- These are pages that are good optimization opportunities. If you improve these pages, you might drive more conversions.
- Try updating copy, content, or layout on these pages to make them convert better.

**When to use this analysis: **

- After publishing updated pages, flows, or traffic campaigns.
- Monthly, to ensure site actions align with business goals.
- When stakeholders ask about the impact of content or design choices.
