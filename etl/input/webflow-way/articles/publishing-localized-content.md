## Publishing strategy by approach

Publishing approach

Why it works

**Translation**

**Asynchronous**, publish the primary locale as soon as content is ready, then push translations when available

Direct translations can safely trail primary content by a few days, especially for low-sensitivity or supporting pages

**Localization**

**Mixed**, publish primary and secondary locales together for major updates; asynchronous for rolling content

Requires alignment on regional context and QA, but not full narrative change

**Transcreation**

**Simultaneous**, publish all locales together to ensure message parity and campaign integrity

Localized storytelling or emotion-driven copy needs to land at the same time globally

## Webflow publishing controls

### Enable publishing for a locale only when ready

New locales can remain in draft until you’re ready to launch. Once publishing is enabled, that locale becomes live across your site.

### Disabling a locale removes it from the live site

Do not use publishing toggles as a “pause”, turning off publishing unpublishes the locale entirely.

### Publishing in the Designer publishes all enabled locales

There’s no “publish just one locale” button. If you need to stage content by locale, use “Draft in locale” per CMS item or static page.

### Preview each locale before publishing

Switching to each locale in the Designer lets you verify layout, SEO, and content. Catch untranslated elements, layout breaks, or placeholder copy.

## Drafting and staging: Tools to support your publishing strategy

Webflow provides controls to help you stage localized content before publishing. These tools support both asynchronous and simultaneous publishing strategies depending on your content goals and level of localization.

**Feature**

How it works

Best used for

**Draft in locale (CMS items)**

CMS items can be held in draft per locale and published independently. This supports **asynchronous publishing** of individual locales.

Rolling out blog posts, articles, or regional content on different timelines.

**Stage all locales (CMS items)**

You can wait to publish a CMS item until **all localized versions are complete**, then publish via the primary item. This supports **synchronous publishing** across locales.

Launching a single CMS entry (e.g. product, case study) in all locales at once.

**Draft in locale (Static pages – Enterprise only)**

Hold individual locale versions of static pages in draft. Other locales can publish independently. Enables **asynchronous publishing** of static content.

Asynchronous rollout of localized landing pages or legal notices.

**Stage all locales (static pages – all plans)**

Publishing any static page publishes all locale versions of that page. You must wait until all versions are complete. Supports **synchronous publishing only**.

Coordinated launches of global homepages, pricing pages, or other marketing content.

**Enable publishing per locale (one-time toggle)**

Keeps a new locale hidden from the live site until you're ready to launch. Once enabled, it remains live.

Staging new locales prior to launch. Not intended for managing ongoing updates.

**Branch staging (Enterprise)**

Stage and QA changes across multiple pages, locales, and CMS items in an isolated workspace. Publish when ready.

Transcreation, product launches, or campaigns with cross-functional input and global timing.

### Aligning staging tools to approach-based publishing

**Approach**

Publishing goal

Recommended use

**Translation**

Publish as soon as content is ready per locale

Use per-locale CMS drafts; static pages require Enterprise for async rollout

**Localization**

Roll out some locales or sections in sync, others independently

Use a mix of per-locale drafts and coordinated publish timing

**Transcreation**

Ensure all content goes live together for message and narrative consistency

Use CMS item staging, static page “stage all,” or Branch Staging for full coordination
