## How it helps teams
Up until now, growing teams have struggled to work on the same site in parallel. Page branching unlocks more efficient collaboration and lets you:
- **Build and ship faster**  with multiple teammates working in the Designer at the same time, your team can ship more updates faster.
- **Increase team productivity**  stop staggering and scheduling design work across your team, or waiting for your turn – single-player in the Designer is now a thing of the past.
- **Safely explore new designs**  work on a branched page in isolation without fear that your teammates will publish work-in-progress design changes.
## How page branching works
![Build on page branches with existing classes and components, or create new classes.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/687e8d1b96312cc631cafec7/68c38798c62d5473ee2a3d97_64f9399ca7d13575ff21d64a_Group%252068%2520(1).jpeg)
Build on page branches with existing classes and components, or create new classes.
Let’s say you’re on a team and you want to make changes to the homepage in isolation while the rest of your team edits and publishes the rest of the site. At a high level, here’s the new workflow you’ll be able to follow:
1. **Branch.** Create a branch of the homepage
2. **Build.** Build on that branch with existing classes and components, or create new styles
3. **Update.** Update the branch with the latest classes and components as the main project evolves
4. **Merge.** Merge the branch into the main project, replacing the original homepage
5. **Publish.** Publish the site with the updated homepage
## What’s next for page branching
This is just the first step to improve the experience for teams of multiple designers using Webflow at the same time. Here’s a look at some of what we’ll be shipping in the future to make page branching workflows even more powerful:
- Modify page settings and classes on branches
- Manage conflicts that arise during merge
- Enrich the [Site Activity log](https://webflow.com/feature/site-activity-log) with branch activity
- Request reviews and approve branch changes before merging
