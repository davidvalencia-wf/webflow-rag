#### Introducing the quick find shortcut for all Webflow users
Starting today, you can use the new quick find shortcut to locate exactly what you’re looking for — whether it’s a site, Workspace, or setting — right from your Dashboard. Just press Command + K or Command + E (or Ctrl + K / Ctrl + E on Windows) to get started.
Explore how the quick find shortcut works in the [Help Center](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961382093587-Quick-find#h_01K9QJHWFFKD5F996EWD1ZF9T3).
#### Bonus: Assign custom names to client workspaces
We know that some Webflow customers have generic Workspace names  like “My Workspace.” If you’re a freelancer or agency who builds for multiple clients, you probably have a long list of Workspaces with these generic names, making it hard to find the right one quickly.
Now, you can assign custom names to client Workspaces and your custom names will appear everywhere in your  Dashboard, including in quick find. This custom name will be visible only to you and your team, not to your client.
