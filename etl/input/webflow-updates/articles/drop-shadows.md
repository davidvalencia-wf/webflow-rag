## Add drop shadows with ease
You can now apply and customize drop shadows directly from the **Style panel > Effects > Filters**. This CSS function allows you to create shadows that conform to the shape of your elements, perfect for images, complex shapes, and more.

### **Why drop shadows?**
Unlike box shadows, drop shadows follow the exact contours of your elements. This means:
- Perfect shadows for transparent images and logos
- Realistic depth effects for irregularly shaped elements
- More natural-looking emphasis for your design components
### **Customize drop shadows**
The new drop shadow filter includes a few properties you can control to get your effect looking just right:
- **X and Y offsets**: control the position of your shadow
- **Blur**: adjust the softness of the shadow's edges
- **Color**: choose your shadow color and opacity with the color picker

### **Adjust across breakpoints**
You can adjust your drop shadow settings at different breakpoints to ensure your design looks great on all devices.
### **Animate with variables**
To animate a drop shadow:
1. In the Style panel, bind variables to the filter’s properties: **x and y offsets**, **blur**, and **color**.
2. In the Interactions panel, create a new animation that includes a “Set variable value” action, and update your drop shadow variables accordingly. This creates a smooth, dynamic drop shadow animation!
