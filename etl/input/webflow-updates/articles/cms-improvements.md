## Nest Collection pages within folders for more URL control

Serve Collection items at URL subdirectories for greater control when fine-tuning SEO.
Before today, all of your Collection pages needed to live only one level down from your root domain. By way of example, here’s how things have worked in the past:
- your “Blog posts” Collection publishes items to _website.com/blog/example-post_
- your “Case studies” Collection publishes to _website.com/customers/example-case-study_
Now you can [set a parent folder in your Collection page settings](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/structure-and-style-collection-pages#general) to serve those pages on a subdirectory URL like:
- “Blog posts” can publish to _website.com/content/blog/example-post_
- _Similarly, your “Case studies” Collection can now be published to website.com/content/customers/example-case-study_
- You can even nest Collection pages [multiple levels deep](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/), for example: _website.com/content/enterprise/blog/example-post_
This new level of control is particularly helpful when it comes to fine-tuning SEO.
## Disable template page publishing for individual Collections
![Turn off publishing for a given Collection to remove its template pages from your sitemap.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/687e8d1b96312cc631cafec7/68c38775d239e3325419b49a_64f9399ca7d13575ff21d66d_a260104d.png)
Turn off publishing for a given Collection to remove its template pages from your sitemap.
For every Collection you create, Webflow [generates a corresponding template page](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/structure-and-style-collection-pages). These template pages aren’t published to your sitemap unless you make changes to the blank template page to begin with — but before today, once you _had_ made changes (however small those might be), those template pages would be live and indexed by search engines.
Now, to prevent those Collection pages from publishing at all, [simply toggle the switch in the Collection settings](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/structure-and-style-collection-pages#publish-settings).
## Duplicate Collection structures to build faster

Duplicate an existing Collection structure to build out your content library a bit faster.
Finally, now you can [duplicate an existing Collection structure](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/webflow-collections-overview#how-to-duplicate-a-collection) to build out your content library a bit faster. Simply open the settings for the Collection you want to duplicate, then hit the Duplicate Collection button at the top.
That’s it! We’re hoping these make your life just a bit easier and unlock new power for your builds in Webflow. Enjoy!
