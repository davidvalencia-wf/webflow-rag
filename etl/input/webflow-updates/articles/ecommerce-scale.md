## Higher ecommerce item limits
Effective today, new and existing Ecommerce Plus and Advanced site plans have higher item limits. That’s it! Let’s take a look at the before and after:
- **Ecommerce Plus** increasing from 1,000 to 5,000 items
- **Ecommerce Advanced** increasing from 3,000 to 15,000 items
These changes are rolling out starting today and should be live across all customer cohorts within the next two weeks. If you need access to these higher limits earlier, reach out to [support@webflow.com](mailto:support@webflow.com) with the URL of your site and we’ll migrate your site earlier.
## Decoupling CMS and Ecommerce item limits
Another update we’ve made is that item limits for CMS items and ecommerce items have been decoupled. Previously, while on an ecommerce site plan, joint item limits applied to your total number of CMS and ecommerce items. This meant that ecommerce site plans were comparable to CMS or Business site plans in every aspect, with the exception of CMS item limits.
Today, in addition to the increased ecommerce item limits, ecommerce plans now have full parity with CMS or Business plans when it comes to CMS item limits. Let’s look at how this breaks down:
**Ecommerce Standard:**
- Previous item limit (ecommerce and CMS joint): 500
- New item limit (ecommerce only): 500
- New item limit (CMS only): 2,000
- Full feature parity with: CMS plan
**Ecommerce Plus:**
- Previous item limit (ecommerce and CMS joint): 1,000
- New item limit (ecommerce only): 5,000
- New item limit (CMS only): 10,000
- Full feature parity with: Business plan
**Ecommerce Advanced:**
- Previous item limit (ecommerce and CMS joint): 3,000
- New item limit (ecommerce only): 15,000
- New item limit (CMS only): 10,000
- Full feature parity with: Business plan
Across ecommerce site plans, subscribers are getting anywhere from 2,000 to 22,000 additional items — across CMS and ecommerce. We look forward to seeing what this unlocks for you!
