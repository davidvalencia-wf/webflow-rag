## Optimize for the new era of search
Marketers are rethinking search as AI changes how people discover brands and information. Webflow has long equipped teams with [powerful SEO](https://webflow.com/feature/seo) and site-management tools, and now we’re expanding that foundation with new AI-powered SEO and AEO capabilities that make it easier to optimize for both search engines and AI systems, all from one place.
These new tools help you:
- Improve discoverability for both SEO and AEO
- Ensure your site is optimized for humans and machines
- Save time by reducing manual SEO tasks and metadata updates
- Publish with confidence, knowing your site follows best practices
## Smarter site audits with AI
With this release, the Audit panel now supports both sitewide and page-level checks, helping you catch and fix issues that impact accessibility and discoverability. You can now audit your **asset library** for missing alt text and review **static pages and Collection pages** for missing meta titles, descriptions, and schema markup.
