## **Improved Localization Support for Components**
We’re rolling out a major improvement to how Components interact with Localization—designed to make your workflow smoother and more predictable.
### **What’s new?**
Localized settings and content are now reliably preserved when you:
- **Create or unlink a component** that includes pre-localized elements.
- **Duplicate a component** from the Components panel.
- **Add new properties** to an existing component.
This means fewer surprises and more confidence when building multilingual experiences with Components.
Creating, unlinking and duplication are available today and new properties will be rolling out over the next few days.
