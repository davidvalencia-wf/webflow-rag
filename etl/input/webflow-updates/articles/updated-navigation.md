## **New tabbed navigation** ‍
The new tabbed navigation makes it easy for teams to quickly and confidently navigate the powerful capabilities Webflow’s platform has to offer across four new tabs:
- Design – move between different modes based on your roles and permissions
- CMS – where you can manage your content including ecommerce and user accounts data
- Insights - where you can find the features and data related to Webflow Analyze and Optimize
- Preview - where you can preview your site, distraction free

The new tabbed navigation lets users move quickly between workflow inside Webflow.
## ‍ **New context bar** ‍
Located at the top of a site’s canvas, the context bar lets you quickly view and filter across the pages, collections, components, breakpoints, experiments and locales you’re designing with—it’s also where you will be able to switch between page branches. Together, this information provides a new level of insight for designers, allowing you to get a comprehensive overview of who you are designing for, in a single glance.
**_A note about breakpoints:_** _In addition to adding a breakpoint switch to the context bar, we have also moved one-click breakpoint switching the breadcrumb bar which can be pinned to either the top, or bottom of the canvas, depending on your preferences!_

The context bar lets you quickly view and filter across your site's building blocks including pages, collections, components, breakpoints and more.
## **Updated site actions** ‍
We’ve also made some small updates to the site actions section of the navigation making it easier tosee who’s working alongside you in Webflow, drop comments throughout a build, and publish your site—whether it’s for staging or going live to production.
**_A note about code exports:_** _As part of this update, you’ll notice that we’ve removed Code Export from this top navigation – however you can continue to access this functionality from the global dropdown menu at the top of left-navigation panel._
