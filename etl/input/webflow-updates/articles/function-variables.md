### What are function variables?
You can set your variable values using CSS functions. That means you can:
- Create fluid, responsive sizes with `clamp()`
- Perform layout math with `calc()`
- Apply logic-based styling with `min()` and `max()`
- Blend and modify colors programatically with `color-mix()`
Just like any other variable in Webflow, these function values can be reused throughout your site and updated from a single source of truth.

### A faster, smarter editing experience
To support Function variables, we’ve refreshed the workflows around how you create, connect, and edit variables:
- **The purple dot menu is now the "Connect" menu** – renamed to better reflect its purpose: connecting style properties to variables, data, or custom values. You’ll also find a new **filter** option to help you quickly find what you need.
- **A redesigned custom value editor** gives you more power and flexibility, with features like:
- Autocomplete for variables and CSS functions
- Built-in MDN references and code snippets
- Multi-cursor editing, keyboard shortcuts, and full support for newlines and tabbing
- **Time-saving shortcuts** streamline your workflow:
- From the Variables panel, paste a CSS function directly into a variable field
- Hit `=` when setting a style property or a variable to jump straight into the function editor
These updates are designed to make dynamic styling feel intuitive, even if you’re not writing CSS by hand.
