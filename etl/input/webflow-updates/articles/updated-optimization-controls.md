#### Re-launch AB tests
Turn tests back on after they've been turned off. When a test is re-launched, we automatically segment your reporting data; one interval will show results from the original run, and the next starts fresh from the re-launch, so you can still get statistically significant results.
#### Edit AB tests
To make changes to AB tests after they have been launched, you can turn the test off, add new variations, update traffic allocation, change goals, adjust your audience, and more, then re-launch once your changes are complete, all while maintaining reporting rigor.
#### Streamlined test management
Manage optimizations from both the canvas and the reporting page (for Webflow-hosted sites). Launch, pause, end, or rename a test directly in context. We’ve also standardized optimization statuses and simplified controls to make it easier to scale your program.
