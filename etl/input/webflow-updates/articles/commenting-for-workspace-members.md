## Free commenter role coming soon
While today’s release is aimed at streamlining feedback between those of you already working and building within Webflow, in the coming months we’ll expand beyond Workspace members and introduce a **free** commenting role so you can invite additional stakeholders to leave feedback on designs.
## How to leave comments
Now when you open the Designer in Webflow, you’ll notice a new icon on the top bar which switches you into a commenting mode. Here you’ll be able to see where feedback has been shared as you navigate around the site, and click on different elements to leave a new comment (fun fact: you can even leave comments at the [breakpoint level](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-breakpoints), and Enterprise teams can comment on [branched pages](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/page-branching)).
The panel on the right side will show you all comments with the ability to navigate directly to the location where feedback was left by clicking on a comment in that list.
