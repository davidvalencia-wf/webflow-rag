## Why This Change?
We’ve made this change to better serve your needs by providing two focused resources:
- **Help Center:** For quick access to technical documentation and support.
- **University:** For deep, goal-oriented learning that helps you master Webflow.
We believe this separation will make it easier for you to find the information you need, whether you’re looking to learn something new or need a quick answer to a question.
If you have any questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team.
