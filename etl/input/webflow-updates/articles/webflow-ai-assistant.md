## Modify page designs
One of the AI Assistant’s skills allows you to design and generate new styled sections quickly.
The Assistant learns from your design systems and site context to generate new sections of a website from conversational prompts. Lean on it to quickly ideate on and build common site sections such as pricing, features, testimonials, and more. Once the Assistant generates a preview of your section, you can further customize it to apply the finishing touches to fit your site.
