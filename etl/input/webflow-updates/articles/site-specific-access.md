## How site-specific access works
Workspace Owners and Admins can set up site access on existing sites and when creating a new site.
As a bonus, we’ve also made improvements to the experience of inviting a new user into Webflow with the ability to set the user’s role and publishing permissions upfront to save you time. We hope this new workflow helps you improve the way you manage and work with your team, guests, and clients in Webflow. For more details on how to start using these features today, check out our [Webflow University article](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/site-specific-access).
_Note for Workspace Admins_: With the addition of site-specific access, Workspace Members will no longer be able to access the Team page – only Workspace Owners and Admins will be able to do so.
## What’s next for teams working in Webflow
Next up we’ll be working on bringing you:
- **Page building** to allow less-technical teammates to quickly build landing pages with components and basic elements while maintaining your brand.
- **Approval workflows** to help you ensure that proposed changes to the site are reviewed and approved by the right stakeholders before they’re merged or published.
- **Granular roles & permissions** to control who can branch pages, publish to staging, the ability to create custom roles, and more.
