## [Work with pseudo-states in the Designer](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/02282025)

Get the current pseudo-state of the designer and subscribe to changes in the pseudo-state. This is helpful for showing specific [style properties](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-style-properties) based on a pseudo-state like `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:active`.

- **[Get the pseudo-state of the designer](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-pseudo-mode)**

Added the `webflow.getPseudoMode()` method to return the [pseudo-class state](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961301727251-States) of the designer.
- **[Subscribe to pseudo-state changes](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/user-changes-pseudo-mode)**

Added options to the `webflow.subscribe()` method to subscribe to changes in the pseudo-state of the designer.

## Get additional site details

- **[Get site information](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-site-info)**

The `getSiteInfo` method now returns the `domains` object in the response.
