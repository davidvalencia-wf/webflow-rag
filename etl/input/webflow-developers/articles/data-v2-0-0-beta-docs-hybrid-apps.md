The most exciting thing about the new App model– with the Data Client capabilities, and the introduction of Designer Extensions–is the power that is available to developers by combining these two building blocks into a single App. This Hybrid App model allows your App to provide a comprehensive user experience by surfacing your App’s UI within the Designer and using the Data Client to manage site data, assets, and more.
