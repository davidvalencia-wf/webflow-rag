## Working with Webflow Cloud

### Projects

Projects are the foundational building blocks in Webflow Cloud. Each project represents a distinct application or service that you want to deploy alongside your Webflow site.

[**Environments** \\
Environments enable you to maintain different versions of your application for development, testing, and production use. Key features include:\\
\\
- Multiple environments per project\\
- Separate environment variables and configurations\\
- Branch-based deployments](https://developers.webflow.com/webflow-cloud/environments) [Learn more about environments →](https://developers.webflow.com/webflow-cloud/environments)

[**Deployments** \\
Deployments represent the process of pushing your code to an environment. Webflow Cloud provides:\\
\\
- Automated build and deployment pipelines\\
- Deployment logs and monitoring](https://developers.webflow.com/webflow-cloud/deployments) [Learn more about deployments →](https://developers.webflow.com/webflow-cloud/deployments)
