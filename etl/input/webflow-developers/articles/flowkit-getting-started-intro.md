## Introduction

Flowkit is a modular CSS Framework designed to power visually consistent and flexible Webflow websites — especially those generated by Webflow AI. It provides a structured collection of reusable utility classes, component patterns, and design tokens that streamline layout, styling, and interactions across your entire site.

Built with scalability and clarity in mind, Flowkit helps:

- Maintain design consistency through [global variables](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961268146323-Variables)
- Style and compose layouts using utility-first [classes](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961311094419-Classes)
- Build and extend [component systems](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961303934611-Components-overview) with predictable class conventions

## Style guide

The Flowkit style guide provides an overview of all the components and utility classes used in the project. Each website generated by Webflow’s AI tools includes a style guide page generated by the Flowkit framework.

##### Note

Style guide is a great place to change styles of the elements and components. To change colors, fonts, or spacing, open the variables panel or make the adjustments directly from the Designer canvas.

## Naming conventions

This framework uses a structured naming system with hyphens and underscores that creates predictable, reusable classes organized into four main types.

### Hyphens ’ - ’ Usage

Hyphens are used to:

1. Connect multiple words within component names, property names, or values:
   - rich-text
   - text-align\_center
   - margin-top\_small
   - background\_primary
2. Define combo class modifiers (component states, surface context, spacing, interactions):
   - is-secondary
   - on-inverse
   - gap-small
3. Responsive modifiers for combo classes:
   - flex\_horizontaltablet-vertical
   - grid\_5-colmobile-2-col

### Underscores ’ \_ ’ Usage

Underscores are used to:

1. Separate components from their parts or properties:
   - card\_body
   - nav\_logo
   - footer\_link
2. Connect utility properties with their values:
   - margin-top\_small
   - width\_40percent
   - z-index\_2
3. Apply responsive variants of utility classes by adding breakpoint postfixes:
   - text-align\_center\_mobile — center-aligned text on mobile
   - width\_100percent\_mobile-l — full width on large mobile

##### Responsive modifiers: `_` vs `-`

There is a clear distinction between **`_`** and **`-`** when working with responsive utility classes in Flowkit:

- **`_mobile`** is used within **utility classes** to apply styles only at a specific breakpoint.

Example:

text-align\_center\_mobile means the text will be center-aligned **only on mobile**.

This class is **scoped to mobile resolution** and does not apply on tablet or desktop.

- **`mobile-`** is used as a **combo modifier** to override or change a base style on mobile.

Example:

text-align\_centermobile-align-left

This means the text is center-aligned by default, but switches to left-aligned **on mobile**.

Use `_mobile` when you want a utility to appear **only at a certain breakpoint**, and `mobile-` (or similar prefixes) when you want to **override an existing style** responsively using a combo class.

* * *

## Class types

There are four main types of classes: `Component`, `Utility`, `Combo`, and `Responsive Modifiers`. Each of these class types follows specific naming patterns for consistency and clarity.

### Component classes

Component classes define standalone UI elements with their own structure and functionality.

**Naming Pattern:** component\_property or component\_part\_property

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| card | Flexible content container with shadow and padding |
| card\_body | The body part of a card component |
| nav | Main website navigation bar |
| nav\_logo | The logo part of a navigation component |
| footer\_link | A link element within the footer |
| footer | Site-wide footer container |
| button | Reusable clickable element |
| banner | Promotional or announcement container |

Component classes define reusable building blocks of the UI and may have nested sub-elements, with naming that follows the parent component.

Here is an example of a Nav component with its nested elements:

nav

nav\_links

nav\_logo-icon

nav\_link

* * *

### Utility classes

Utility classes provide single-purpose styling that can be applied to any element.

**Naming Pattern:** property\_value

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| margin-top\_medium | Applies medium top margin |
| padding-horizontal\_large | Applies large padding on both sides |
| z-index\_2 | Sets z-index to 2 |
| background\_primary | Sets background to primary color |
| text-align\_center | Centers text horizontally |
| text-align\_left | Applies left text alignment |
| text-align\_right | Applies right text alignment |
| display\_inline-block | Applies inline-block display |

##### Note

Utility classes may apply multiple CSS properties, but always serve a single visual purpose.

* * *

### Combo classes

Combo classes are modifiers that change the appearance or behavior of components. They use specific prefixes to indicate their purpose.

| Prefix | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| is- | Component-related modifiers |
| on- | Surface context modifiers |
| gap- | Spacing modifiers for flex and grid |
| ix- | Interactions related |
| tablet-, mobile-l-, mobile- | Responsive modifiers |

Combo classes are always following a main class: `main class``prefix`-`modifier-name`

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| buttonis-secondary | Changes button to secondary style |
| text-linkon-accent-primary | Adapts text link for accent-primary background |
| flex\_horizontalgap-medium | Sets medium gap in flex container |
| sectionis-secondary | Adjust section background and text color |

* * *

### Responsive modifiers

Responsive modifiers apply styles at specific breakpoints. They use device-specific postfixes.

**Postfix:**

- \_tablet \- Tablets
- \_mobile-l \- Mobile landscape
- \_mobile \- Mobile portrait

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| width\_100percent\_tablet | Changes an element to full width on tablet screens |
| text-align\_center\_mobile | Centers text on mobile screens |

* * *

## Sizes

T-shirt sizing provides a consistent way to name size-related classes for things like spacing, borders, text, and icons.

| Size | Example |
| --- | --- |
| xxsmall | iconis-xxsmall |
| xsmall | iconis-xsmall |
| small | radius\_small |
| medium | text\_medium |
| large | gap\_large |
| xlarge | radius\_xlarge |
| xxlarge | padding-top\_xxlarge |

This scale applies to layouts, spacing, typography, shadows, and other properties.

* * *

## Surface modifiers

The following surface modifiers are used across button, text, nav, icon, and card components. These follow the on-\[surface\] naming structure and appear in combinations for alternate background styling.

| Surface | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Accent Primary | buttonis-secondaryon-accent-primary |
| Accent Secondary | text-linkon-accent-secondary |
| Accent Tertiary | iconon-accent-tertiary |
| Primary | card-linkon-primary |
| Secondary | card-linkon-secondary |
| Inverse | buttonon-inverse |

* * *

## Animation modifiers

Animation-related classes that are used in [Webflow Interactions](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961310025107-Intro-to-Interactions) follow the ix\_ prefix convention. These classes are not responsible for styling but act as hooks for applying interactions and animations defined in the Webflow Interactions panel.

Examples:

| Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ix\_section-scroll-in | Triggers scroll-based entrance animation for sections |
| ix\_image-zoom-hover | Targets images that scale on hover |
| ix\_nav-slide-out | Animates navigation on mobile menu toggle |
| ix\_button-tap | Adds tap/click animation to buttons |
| ix\_card-flip | Triggers flip animation for card components |
