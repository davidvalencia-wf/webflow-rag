## Class Naming

Cards are layout containers used to group and display content like text, images, and interactive elements. They are styled using the base class card for standard cards and card-link for interactive cards.

These classes can be extended using modifiers for different styles, backgrounds, and layouts.

## Surface Modifiers

Use these modifiers (combo classes) to adapt the card appearance based on the background context.

Naming convention:
cardon-`Surface` and card-linkon-`Surface`, where card surface can be `primary`, `secondary`, `inverse`, `accent-primary`, `accent-secondary`, `accent-tertiary`

Example:

- cardon-accent-primary
- card-linkon-inverse

## Card Elements

These modifiers allow additional control over spacing and card behavior across responsive layouts.

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| card\_body | Default card padding. |
| card\_body\_small | Small card padding. |
| cardis-featured | Makes the card stand out from others. Useful for featured pricing cards. |
