## [Create and manage variable collections](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/02062025)

Variable collections provide an organizational structure for managing related variables. Collections allow you to group variables logically - for example, you might create separate collections for brand colors, typography, or spacing variables. Collections help maintain a clean and organized variable system, making it easier to manage design tokens at scale across your projects.

Use the following endpoints to create and manage [variable collections](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/variable-collections-overview).

- [Create variable collection](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/create-variable-collection)
- [Get all variable collections](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-all-variable-collections)
- [Get default variable collection](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-default-variable-collection)
- [Get variable collection by ID](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-variable-collection-by-id)
- [Remove variable collection](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/remove-variable-collection)
- [Set variable collection name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-variable-collection-name)
