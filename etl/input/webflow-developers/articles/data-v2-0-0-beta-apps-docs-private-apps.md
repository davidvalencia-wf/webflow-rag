Private apps in the Webflow Marketplace enable you to publish and share your app while maintaining control over its distribution. This guide explains how private apps work and how to manage them.

## What are private apps?

Private apps are fully functional Webflow apps that are not publicly listed in the Marketplace. The key difference between private and public apps is discover
ability - private apps maintain all core features and capabilities while offering controlled distribution through direct install URL sharing.

## When should you use a private app?

Private apps are a great option for:

- **Internal apps used by a single organization**

Apps built for use within a single company or organization. These apps can help streamline internal workflows, integrate with company systems, or provide specialized functionality for employees.
- **Custom apps developed for a specific client or set of clients**

Custom solutions developed for one or more specific clients. These apps are tailored to meet particular client needs and aren’t intended for broader distribution.
- **Apps that are not ready for public distribution**

Apps that are still in development or testing phases and aren’t yet ready for public release can be submitted as a private app. This allows you to test with a limited audience before considering wider distribution.

### Key characteristics

- Not visible on the public Marketplace. Private apps do not have a Marketplace listing page.
- Installable in both app developer’s workspace and external user workspaces
- Access controlled via direct Install URL sharing
- Maintains full API capabilities and integrations
- Can be monetized (subject to standard Marketplace terms)

## Publishing a private app

### Submission process

1. Submit your app through the standard Marketplace submission form
2. Select the **“Private”** option in the “Marketplace Visibility” section of the submission form
3. Complete all required app information and documentation
4. Submit for review

Private apps undergo the same rigorous review process as public apps to ensure quality and security standards are met.

### Managing access

Once your private app is approved:

1. You’ll receive a unique Install URL for your app
2. Share this URL directly with intended users
3. Only users with the Install URL can access and install your app

## Best practices

- Maintain clear documentation for your private app users
- Keep track of who you’ve shared your Install URL with
- Regularly communicate updates and changes to your users
