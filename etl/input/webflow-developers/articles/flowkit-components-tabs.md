Each tab button uses a base class and can be styled to reflect different backgrounds or interface variants.

The base class is: tab\_menu-button

## Surface Modifiers

Use these to adapt the tab appearance based on the background context.

Naming convention for combo classes is tab\_menu-buttonon-`surface`,

where `surface` can be `inverse`, `accent-primary`, `accent-tertiary`, or `accent-secondary`.

Example:

tab\_menu-buttonon-inverse

## Style Modifiers

Additional style options for tabs is tab\_menu-link. It removes tab background but keeps underline and label styling.
