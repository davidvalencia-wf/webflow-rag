- **[Create Option fields](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/cms/collection-fields/create)**

Option fields let you define a predefined list of choices for a collection item. You can add these fields either when creating a new collection via the [create collection](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/cms/collections/create) endpoint or add them to existing collections using the [create collection field](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/cms/collection-fields/create) endpoint.
