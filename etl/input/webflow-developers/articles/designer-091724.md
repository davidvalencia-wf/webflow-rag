## [Subscribe to mode changes in the Designer](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/091724)

Designer Extensions now remain active across [various modes in the Designer](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/app-modes), including preview mode, across different locales, and on branched pages. Different capabilities are available depending on the mode, so it’s important to know when a mode changes. This update introduces a new event subscription method to help you track mode changes in the Designer.

- **[Subscribe to mode changes in the Designer](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/user-changes-mode)**

Receive real-time notifications when users switch between different Designer modes. Since each mode offers distinct capabilities based on user permissions, this subscription helps your app adapt its functionality accordingly. For detailed information about available modes and their capabilities, refer to the [App Modes documentation](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/app-modes).
