## Introduction

Flowkit is a modular CSS Framework designed to power visually consistent and flexible Webflow websites — especially those generated by Webflow AI. It provides a structured collection of reusable utility classes, component patterns, and design tokens that streamline layout, styling, and interactions across your entire site.

Built with scalability and clarity in mind, Flowkit helps:

- Maintain design consistency through [global variables](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961268146323-Variables)
- Style and compose layouts using utility-first [classes](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961311094419-Classes)
- Build and extend [component systems](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961303934611-Components-overview) with predictable class conventions

## Style guide

The Flowkit style guide provides an overview of all the components and utility classes used in the project. Each website generated by Webflow’s AI tools includes a style guide page generated by the Flowkit framework.

##### Note

Style guide is a great place to change styles of the elements and components. To change colors, fonts, spacing open variables panel or do the adjustments straight from the Designer canvas.

## Class types

There are three main types of classes: `Base`, `Component`, and `Utility`. Each of these class types can be extended with a [combo class](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961311094419-Classes#how-to-create-a-combo-class) — a modifier that adjusts or enhances the behavior and appearance of the main class.

### Base classes

Base classes are structural classes used to define the foundational layout of the page. These are typically applied to [semantic elements](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961369965715-Semantic-HTML5-tags) like `section` or `div` and provide the scaffolding for layout composition.

| Class Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Section | Semantic top-level page wrapper (`section` tag) |
| Container | Horizontal padding and max-width control |
| Grid Layout | Layout grid system using CSS Grid |
| Flex Horizontal | Flexbox layout in horizontal direction |
| Flex Vertical | Flexbox layout in vertical direction |
| Masonry Layout | Masonry-style layout for variable-height content |

These can be extended with combo classes to adjust functionality or visual context:

### Component classes

Component classes are used for specific UI components like buttons, navigation, cards, and footers.

Examples of component classes:

| Class Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Nav | Main website navigation bar |
| Footer | Site-wide footer container |
| Card | Flexible content container with shadow and padding |
| Button | Reusable clickable element |
| Banner | Promotional or announcement container |

Component classes define reusable building blocks of the UI and may have nested sub-elements, with naming that follows the parent component.

Component Nested Element

Here is the example how a Nav component with its nested elements looks like:

Nav Link

Nav Icon

Nav Label

### Utility classes

Utility classes are prefixed with `[Utility]` and describe single-purpose styling.

| Utility Class | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| \[Utility\] Display Inline Block | Applies inline-block display |
| \[Utility\] Text Align Center | Centers text horizontally |
| \[Utility\] Margin Top 4rem | Adds top margin of 4rem |
| \[Utility\] Width 60% | Sets width to 60% |

##### Note

Utility classes may apply multiple CSS properties, but always serve a single visual purpose.

## Responsive modifiers

Responsive modifiers are used to change the default behavior of the main class on a [specific breakpoint](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961300305811-Breakpoints-overview).

| Modifier | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tablet | Tablets | \[Utility\] Padding Top 2rem \[Tablet\] |
| Mobile L | Mobile landscape | \[Utility\] Text Color Primary \[Mobile L\] |
| Mobile | Mobile portrait | \[Utility\] Margin Bottom Auto \[Mobile P\] |

* * *

## Sizes

T-shirt sizing provides a consistent way to name size-related classes for things like spacing, borders, text, and icons.

| Size | Example |
| --- | --- |
| XXS | Icon XXS |
| XS | Padding Bottom XS |
| SM | Radius SM |
| MD | Text MD |
| LG | Gap LG |
| XL | Radius XL |
| XXL | Padding Top XXL |
| XXXL | Margin Bottom XXXL |

* * *

## Surface modifiers

The following surface modifiers are used across button, text, nav, icon, and card components. These follow the `On [Surface]` naming structure and appear in combinations for alternate background styling.

| Surface | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Accent Primary | Secondary Button On Accent Primary |
| Accent Secondary | Text Link On Accent Secondary |
| Accent Tertiary | Icon On Accent Tertiary |
| Primary | Card Link On Primary |
| Secondary | Card Link On Secondary |
| Inverse | Primary Button On Inverse |

* * *

## Animation modifiers

Animation-related classes that are used in [Webflow Interactions](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961310025107-Intro-to-Interactions) follow the `[IX]` prefix convention. These classes are not responsible for styling but act as hooks for applying interactions and animations defined in the Webflow Interactions panel.

Examples:

| Class Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| \[IX\] Section Scroll In | Triggers scroll-based entrance animation for sections |
| \[IX\] Image Zoom Hover | Targets images that scale on hover |
| \[IX\] Nav Slide Out | Animates navigation on mobile menu toggle |
| \[IX\] Button Tap | Adds tap/click animation to buttons |
| \[IX\] Card Flip | Triggers flip animation for card components |
