## [Control form settings and fields](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/04082025)

We’ve added new methods to manage form settings using the Designer API. This means you can now create forms using the [element creation methods](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/elements-overview#creating-elements) with the `FormForm` element preset. Once the form is created, or if you already have a form created, you can use the new methods to manage the following settings:

- **Name:** the name of the form
- **Redirect URL:** the URL to redirect to after the form is submitted
- **Action:** the URL to send the form data to
- **Method:** the HTTP method to use when sending the form data
