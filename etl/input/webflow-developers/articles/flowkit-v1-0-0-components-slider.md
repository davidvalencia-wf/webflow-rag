## Navigation

Sliders use arrows for navigation. These arrows are styled using a base class, and surface modifiers can be added to adapt to different backgrounds.

The base class is Slider Arrow.

This can be extended with directional modifiers for navigation:

- Slider ArrowLeft
- Slider ArrowRight

## Surface Modifiers

Use these to adapt the slider arrows to dark backgrounds.
