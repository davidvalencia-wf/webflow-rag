## Support for variable modes

Variable modes let you define multiple values for individual variables, creating distinct sets of values (“modes”) that can be switched and applied across a site.

Use the following endpoints to create and manage variable modes:

- [Create variable mode](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/create-variable-mode)
- [Get all variable modes](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-all-variable-modes)
- [Get variable mode by ID](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-variable-mode-by-id)
- [Get variable mode by name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-variable-mode-by-name)
- [Remove variable mode](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/remove-variable-mode)
- [Get variable mode name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-variable-mode-name)
- [Set variable mode name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-variable-mode-name)

Get and set variable values for a specific mode:

- **[Set mode-specific variable value](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-variable-value)**

You can now include an option parameter to set a mode-specific variable value.
- **[Get mode-specific variable value](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/get-variable-value)**

You can now include an option parameter to get a mode-specific variable value.

## Managing forms

Webflow’s Designer API now supports the following methods for Form elements:

- [Get form name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/form-element/get-form-name)
- [Set form name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/form-element/set-form-name)
