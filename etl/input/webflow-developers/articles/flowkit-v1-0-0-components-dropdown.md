## Class Naming

The dropdown component is used to display a list of options that appear on interaction. It uses a base wrapper class and internal toggle/list elements to manage behavior and style.

The base class is Dropdown. This class wraps the entire dropdown structure and controls visibility of the dropdown list.

## Elements

| Class | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Dropdown Toggle | Interactive button that reveals the dropdown |
| Dropdown List | Container for the list of options |

## Direction Modifiers

Dropdowns support directional modifiers that control where the dropdown list appears in relation to the toggle button.

Combine these with Dropdown List to control layout.

| Modifier Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Open Left Dropdown | Opens list to the left |
| Open Up Dropdown | Opens list above the toggle |
| Open Up Left Dropdown | Opens list above and to the left |

Example: Dropdown ListOpen Left Dropdown
