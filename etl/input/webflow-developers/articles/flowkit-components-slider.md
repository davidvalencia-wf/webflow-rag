| --- | --- |
| slider | The main wrapper element for the slider |
| slider\_mask | A container that clips and holds the visible slide content |

## Navigation

Sliders use arrows for navigation. These arrows are styled using a base class, and surface modifiers can be added to adapt to different backgrounds.

The base class is slider\_arrow.

### Directional Modifiers

This can be extended with directional modifiers for navigation:

- slider\_arrowis-previous
- slider\_arrowis-next

## Surface Modifiers

Use these to adapt the slider arrows to dark backgrounds.

slider\_arrowis-inverse
