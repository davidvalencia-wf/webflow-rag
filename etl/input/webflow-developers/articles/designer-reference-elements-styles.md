Styles are key to creating dynamic and responsive designs in Webflow.

Styles are managed through [Classes](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/style-panel-overview?topics=layout-design#classes-overview) in the Designer interface. When working with the API, these Classes are represented as [Style Objects](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/styles-overview) that contain CSS properties. The methods in this section allow you to programmatically control which styles are applied to elements.
