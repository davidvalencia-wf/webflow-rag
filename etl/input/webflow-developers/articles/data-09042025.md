## [Webflow's MCP server now supports the Designer](https://developers.webflow.com/data/09042025)

Webflow’s MCP server now supports the Designer API, enabling AI agents to interact directly with the Webflow Designer canvas in real-time. This pivotal update expands the server’s capabilities beyond content management, opening new possibilities for AI-assisted visual design.

## What’s new

The MCP server now includes tools that connect directly to the Webflow Designer, allowing AI agents to:

- Create and modify design elements on the canvas
- Manage styles, variables, and components
- Work with responsive breakpoints and layouts
- Access real-time design data and structure

### Companion app for Designer connectivity

![MCP Companion App](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://webflow.docs.buildwithfern.com/2025-11-12T14:56:23.206Z/products/data/pages/Changelog/assets/bridge-app.png)

A new companion app automatically installs during authorization and enables seamless communication between your AI agent and the Designer:

- **Automatic setup**: The companion app installs automatically when you authorize the MCP server
- **Real-time sync**: Maintains a persistent connection between your AI agent and active design sessions
- **Designer access**: Must remain open in the Designer for MCP tools to function

#### Companion app connectivity

**Keep the companion app open**: The MCP Companion App must remain open in the Webflow Designer for Designer API tools to function. Close the app, and you’ll lose access to canvas-based operations.

## Getting started

To use the new Designer API features:

1. **Update your MCP configuration** following the [installation guide](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools)
2. **Authorize your sites** through the OAuth flow (the companion app installs automatically)
3. **Open the Designer** and launch the “Webflow MCP Companion App” from the Apps panel
4. **Start designing** with AI-powered prompts like “Create a hero section with responsive design”

## Important requirements

### Node.js version 22.3.0+

The MCP server now requires Node.js version **22.3.0** or higher. If you’re using an older version:

- Use `nvm` to install and switch to Node.js 22.3.0
- Clear your `npx` cache: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`
- Restart your AI client after updating

See the [Node.js compatibility section](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#nodejs-compatibility) for detailed troubleshooting steps.
