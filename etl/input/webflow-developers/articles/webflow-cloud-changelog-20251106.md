## [Storage for Webflow Cloud is now generally available](https://developers.webflow.com/webflow-cloud/changelog/20251106)

We’re excited to announce that storage for Webflow Cloud is now generally available.

With storage, you’re no longer required to connect to external data stores to save or retrieve data. Now, you can use built-in connections to securely store, manage, and access your data right inside your Webflow Cloud project.

Try it out today and start building with real data in minutes.
