## Welcome to the Webflow Marketplace

## App visibility: Public vs. private

When you publish your app, you can choose to make it public or private:

- **Public apps** are listed in the Marketplace and discoverable by all users.
- **Private apps** aren’t listed publicly. You control who can install your app by sharing a direct install URL. [Learn more about private apps](https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0-beta/apps/docs/private-apps).

## User testing before publishing

Want to test your app with a small group before going live? You can:

- Request to add up to **5** test users by emailing [developers@webflow.com](mailto:developers@webflow.com?Subject=Request%20to%20add%20test%20users%20to%20my%20app) with their Webflow emails.
- Once added, share your app’s install URL so they can try it out.

For full details, see [Testing and managing private apps](https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0-beta/apps/docs/private-apps).

## FAQs

###### Do I have to publicly share my app on the Marketplace?

No. You can publish your app as a **private app** and control who can install it. Select the **“Private”** option in the “Marketplace Visibility” section during submission. All private apps are reviewed just like public apps. [Learn more about private apps](https://developers.webflow.com/data/v2.0.0-beta/apps/docs/private-apps).

###### Can I update my app after it's been published?

Yes. You can submit updates at any time. Updates go through the same review process as your initial submission. Use the “Submit an App” form and select “App Update” as the submission type.
