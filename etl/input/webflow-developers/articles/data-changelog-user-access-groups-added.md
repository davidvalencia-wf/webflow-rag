## [User Access Groups Added](https://developers.webflow.com/data/changelog/user-access-groups-added)

## Added user access groups

The Data API now supports the [List Access Groups](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/access-groups/list) endpoint. This endpoint enables you to see the Access Groups available for a site. Additionally, the API accepts the `access_group` parameter for the [Invite User](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/invite) endpoint to assign a group with an invite.
