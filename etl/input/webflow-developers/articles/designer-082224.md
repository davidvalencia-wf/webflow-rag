## [Subscribe to CMS collection page changes](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/082224)

The Designer API now includes a new event subscription method for CMS collection pages:

- **[Subscribe to CMS Collection Page Events](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/user-changes-cms-page)**

Track when users interact with CMS collection pages and items. This event triggers in two scenarios:
  - When a user navigates to a collection page
  - When a user selects a different CMS item within a collection page

This event subscription works with both CMS and Ecommerce collection pages.
