## [Introducing Flowkit v2](https://developers.webflow.com/flowkit/changelog/2025-07-25)

## What’s new in Flowkit v2?

### New naming conventions

- **Hyphens and underscores**: Strategic use that mirrors generated CSS and defines component relationships. Hyphens separate modifiers and properties, while underscores connect main classes and component parts
- **Combo classes**: Enhanced approach to combo classes using prefixes: `is-`, `on-`, `gap-`, and responsive modifiers `tablet-`, `mobile-l-`, and `mobile-`.
- **Size scales**: Full word naming (`xsmall`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`)

### New grid system

- **Basic grid classes**: `grid`, `grid-1-col` through `grid-12-col`
- **Responsive behavior**: Automatic column adjustments across breakpoints
- **Spacing utilities**: Integrated gap and padding controls through combo classes
- **Alignment options**: Horizontal and vertical alignment modifiers
- **Responsive column modifiers**: Breakpoint-specific column adjustments

### Style guide

**Simplified**: All the technical documentation now is moved to the docs. Style guide keeps only top level brand styles and essential components.
