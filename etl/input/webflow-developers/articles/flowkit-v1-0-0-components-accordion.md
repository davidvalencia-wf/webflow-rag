## Class Naming

The accordion component is used to toggle the visibility of content in a vertically stacked format. It uses a base wrapper class and relies on two key internal elements for structure and interactivity.

The base class is Accordion

## Elements

These elements are usually built using Webflow’s dropdown component but styled with the above classes for visual consistency and behavior within the framework.

| Class | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Accordion Toggle | Button that triggers the open/close behavior |
| Accordion Content | The content area that expands/collapses |
