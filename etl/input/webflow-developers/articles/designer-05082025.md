## [Support for combo classes](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/05082025)

The Designer API now supports the creation of [combo classes](https://help.webflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/33961311094419-Classes#how-to-create-a-combo-class). Combo classes are a way to override the styles of an existing parent class. This is useful for creating unique variations of a style without having to create an entirely new class.

In the Designer API, you can now create combo classes using the [`createStyle` method](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/create-style) and passing an existing style to the `parent` property. For example, if you have a parent class called `button` and you want to create a new style that applies a different color for a specific button, you can do the following:

my-app.ts

```
// Create a style for the button
const buttonStyle = await webflow.createStyle('button')

// Add properties to the style
await buttonStyle.setProperties({
  "background-color": "grey",
  "font-size": "16px",
  "font-weight": "bold",
});

// Create a combo class that applies the new style to the button
const comboClass = await webflow.createStyle('button-primary', {parent: 'button'})

// Add properties to the combo class
await comboClass.setProperties({
  "background-color": "blue",
});

// Check if the class is a combo class
const isComboClass = await comboClass.isComboClass()
```

## Form and asset methods

Additionally, the Designer API now supports the following methods for forms and assets:

**Forms**

- [Get name for a form input element](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/form-element/get-name-input-field)
- [Set name for a form input element](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/form-element/set-name-input-field)

**Assets**

- [Replace asset](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-asset-file)
- [Set asset name](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/set-asset-name)
