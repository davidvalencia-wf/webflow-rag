This guide provides an overview of how to configure your Webflow Designer Extension. You’ll understand the project structure, and how to customize its behavior with `webflow.json`.

## Initializing your project

We strongly recommend starting your project with the `webflow extension init` command. This will create a project foundation tailored for Designer Extensions and ensure all necessary dependencies and configurations are installed correctly.

```
webflow extension init <your-project-name>
```

The CLI also supports templates for specific libraries and languages like React and TypeScript. You can view available templates by running `webflow extension list`.

## Understanding the project structure

After running the `init` command, your project will have a specific file structure. The `public` folder contains all the files needed to serve your Designer Extension.

### Key files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/src/index.ts` | The entry point for your extension’s logic. Write your TypeScript code here to interact with the Designer APIs. |
| `/public/index.html` | The main HTML file for your extension’s interface. This file should only contain the contents of the `<body>` tag. |
| `/public/index.js` | The compiled JavaScript output from `/src/index.ts`. This file is automatically generated. |
| `/public/styles.css` | The CSS file for styling your extension. |
| `webflow.json` | The manifest file used to configure your extension’s settings and behavior. |

### Referencing assets

When linking to CSS and JavaScript files in `index.html`, always use relative paths (e.g., `./styles.css`) instead of absolute paths (e.g., `/styles.css`). This ensures your assets are loaded correctly.

## App settings (`webflow.json`)

The `webflow.json` file is the manifest that controls your app’s behavior. Here are the available properties:

namestringRequired

Specifies the name of the Webflow App. It should be a descriptive and unique name that helps identify the app.

apiVersionstringOptional

The version of the Designer APIs your app is using. It’s highly recommended to set this value to `"2"`

sizestringOptional

Defines the size of the Designer Extension window. Available sizes include:

- `default`: 240px by 360px
- `comfortable`: 320px by 460px
- `large`: 800px by 600px

If a size is not declared, the window defaults to `default`. You can also dynamically change the size using the `webflow.setExtensionSize()` [API](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/resize-extension).

publicDirstringOptional

Determines the directory to build and serve the app from. If not declared, it defaults to `/public`.

appIntentsstringOptional

Defines the element types that can create connections to your App. [See the documentation on App Intents for more details.](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/app-intents-and-connections)

appConnectionsstringOptional

An array of unique identifiers for establishing connections between your app and elements on the canvas. [See the documentation on App Connections for more details.](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/app-intents-and-connections)

## Building and running locally

The scaffold for your extension includes a TypeScript file at `src/index.ts`. Use this file to interact with the Designer APIs.

When you’re ready to test, run the `npm run build` command. This transpiles your TypeScript into JavaScript, outputting the result to `/public/index.js`. Do not modify `/public/index.js` directly, as it will be overwritten.

To run your extension locally, use the `webflow extension serve` command. This will allow you to interact with your extension within the Webflow Designer.

## Bundling for production

When you’re ready to publish, you need to bundle your extension. This process compiles your code and creates a `bundle.zip` file. You can read more about how to bundle your extension in our [guide on publishing your extension](https://developers.webflow.com/apps/docs/publishing-your-app).

If you used `webflow extension init`, you can run:

```
npm run build
```

Otherwise, use the CLI command:

```
webflow extension bundle
```

##### Working with Frameworks

For frameworks like Next.js that generate browser-ready files, build with the framework first, then run `webflow extension bundle` on the output directory.
