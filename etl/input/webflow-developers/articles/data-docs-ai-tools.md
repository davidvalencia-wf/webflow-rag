The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server connects your AI tools directly to your Webflow projects. Prompt an AI agent to update designs, manage site data, and work with the CMS from your preferred AI environment.

For developers using AI-powered tools like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), the MCP server enhances an agent’s understanding of your Webflow projects. It’s built on Webflow’s APIs, exposing them as tools your AI agent can use to create elements, styles, and variables on the canvas, as well as manage collections, custom code, assets, and other site data.

See the full list of available tools in the [MCP server documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webflow-mcp-server).

## Installation

Get started by installing Webflow’s remote MCP server, which uses OAuth to authenticate with your Webflow sites, and a companion app that syncs your live canvas with your AI agent.

##### Companion app

The MCP server companion app can only be installed when you authorize the MCP server to your sites/workspace. It is not a public app on the Webflow app marketplace.

For local installation, please refer to the instruction in the [NPM package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webflow-mcp-server).

### Requirements

Node.js version **22.3.0** or higher.

##### Node.js Version Management

Currently, the MCP server only supports Node.js version **22.3.0** or higher. See the [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#nodejs-compatibility) section for more information on troubleshooting Node.js issues.

## How the MCP server works

The Webflow MCP server implements [Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol specification](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/model-context-protocol-mcp) to standardize communication between AI agents and Webflow’s APIs.

### Architecture

The server acts as a translation layer that exposes Webflow’s APIs as MCP tools. Built as an [open-source package](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server), it wraps Webflow’s REST and Designer APIs into a format that any MCP-compatible AI agent can understand and execute.

### Remote deployment

The server runs remotely to enable OAuth authentication, allowing you to:

- Authorize multiple Webflow sites without storing API keys locally
- Maintain secure, token-based access to your projects

This architecture eliminates the need to manage API credentials in your local environment while providing secure access to your Webflow projects.

##### Remote authorization is currently experimental

Remote authorization relies on the [`mcp-remote` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote), which is currently considered experimental.

### Available tools

The MCP server exposes Data and Designer APIs as MCP tools. See the complete list of available tools and their parameters in the [MCP server repository](https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server/tree/main/src/tools).

###### Designer API tools

###### Data API tools

[**Designer API**](https://developers.webflow.com/designer/reference/introduction) tools enable real-time canvas manipulation:

- **Visual design**: Create and modify elements, styles, and components
- **Layout control**: Manage responsive breakpoints and positioning
- **Design system**: Work with variables, classes, and component instances
- **Live preview**: See changes instantly in the Designer interface

#### Designer companion app

Designer API calls are executed through a companion app that automatically installs to your authorized sites after OAuth authorization. **The companion app must remain open in the Webflow Designer** for Designer API tools to function. However, you can minimize it once connected.

![MCP Bridge App](https://files.buildwithfern.com/https://webflow.docs.buildwithfern.com/2025-11-12T14:56:23.206Z/products/data/pages/Resources/assets/bridge-app.png)

## LLMS.txt documentation

With Webflow’s LLMS.txt file, you can access Webflow’s documentation in your AI client without needing to load the webpage in your browser. This optimized structure helps LLMs respond with accurate code snippets and multi-step sequences.

- **LLMS.txt**

Use [`https://developers.webflow.com/llms.txt`](https://developers.webflow.com/llms.txt) to access the LLM-readable documentation.
- **Markdown docs**

Additionally, you can access markdown versions of any page on the docs site to provide a more structured and context-rich experience for LLMs. To access the markdown version of a page, add `.md` to the end of the URL. For example, this current doc is available as a markdown file at [`https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools.md`](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools.md).

**Using LLMS.txt docs with Cursor**

[1](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#step) In the chat, click the `@` button

[2](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#step-1) Find the “Docs” option

[3](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#step-2) Click “Add new doc”

[4](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#step-3) Paste in the following link: `https://developers.webflow.com/llms.txt`

Once configured, reference Webflow’s documentation by typing `@Docs` in your chat window and selecting “Webflow” from the list.

## FAQs and troubleshooting

### Installation and authentication

###### Why is my MCP server not appearing in my AI client?

After installing the MCP server, you may need to restart your AI client to see the new server. Additionally, check to see that your client (for example, Cursor, Claude Desktop) is updated to the latest version.

###### How can I authenticate a different Webflow site?

To authenticate a different Webflow site, you’ll need to remove the existing authentication token by running the following command in your terminal:

```
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```

After executing the command, a new authentication screen should appear, allowing you to select the site you want to authenticate with.

###### I'm getting an error when loading the remote MCP server

You may receive an `500` error when loading the remote MCP server.

1. Try refreshing your OAuth token with the following command and then restart your AI client:

```
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth
```

2. Check your current Node.js version to ensure you’re using version **22.3.0** or higher:

```
node --version
```

If you can’t use **versions 22.3.0** or higher as your default Node.js version, follow the [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#nodejs-compatibility) section to troubleshoot compatibility issues.

###### Troubleshooting Node.js and NPM issues

**Ensure Node.js and NPM are properly installed**

1. Verify Node.js and NPM installation by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

2. If you encounter issues with `npx`, try clearing your NPM cache:

```
npm cache clean --force
```

3. If `npm -v` only works with `sudo`, you may need to fix NPM global package permissions. See the [official NPM docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) for more information.

If the issue persists, see the [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.webflow.com/data/docs/ai-tools#nodejs-compatibility) section above for version requirements.

If you make changes to your shell configuration, you may need to restart your shell for changes to take effect.

###### The sites I want to authorized are greyed out on the authorization page

Currently, only site owners and admins can authorize the MCP server and app. If you aren’t a site owner or admin, you can’t authorize the MCP server and app.

### Tools and prompts

###### The MCP Server can't connect to the Webflow Designer

To use the MCP server with the Webflow Designer, open the “MCP Bridge App” from the Apps panel. Once open, the app will automatically connect to the MCP server.
