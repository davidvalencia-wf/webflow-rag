## [Enhanced Ecommerce API Support](https://developers.webflow.com/data/changelog/march-2020-updates)

## Ecommerce API restructuring

The Ecommerce API is now organized into three distinct modules:

- **Collections API** \- Manage product collections and categories
- **Orders API** \- Handle order processing and fulfillment
- **Inventory API** \- Track and manage product inventory

## New collection models

Added collection models to support ecommerce operations:

- **Products** \- Full product information and details
- **SKUs** \- Stock keeping units with variant support
- **Categories** \- Hierarchical product categorization

## New endpoints

- **[Create Product](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/ecommerce/products/create)**

Add new products to your store with detailed specifications
- **[List Products](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/ecommerce/products/list)**

Retrieve all products with filtering options
- **[Get Product](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/ecommerce/products/get)**

Fetch detailed information about specific products

These changes provide a more robust foundation for building and managing ecommerce applications with Webflow.
