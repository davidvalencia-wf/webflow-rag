Except as expressly provided herein, Webflow does not grant any license, express, or implied, to the Intellectual Property of Webflow or its licensors, including but not limited to the Platform, the Marketplace, Developer Resources, and Webflow Marks. Webflow retains all right, title and interest in its Intellectual Property, including, but not limited to, the Platform, the Marketplace, and Developer Resources.

2. **Subscription Agreement**. For clarity, this Agreement exclusively governs Developer’s participation in the Marketplace. Any end use of the Platform by Customers, Developer or its End Users, and/or any of their authorized users is governed separately under the applicable Subscription Agreement.

3. **Developer Resources**. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions in this Agreement, you may use the Developer Resources to develop your Application, but only as permitted by the Marketplace Guidelines. All of your use rights in this Agreement (including your rights to use Webflow Marks) are limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-free, and revocable.

4. **Marketplace**. Webflow maintains sole discretion to determine all features and operations of the Marketplace. You acknowledge that Webflow has no obligation to promote, distribute, list, or offer any Application on the Marketplace. Webflow may determine in its sole discretion to make available or list any Application on the Marketplace, or to remove any Application from the Marketplace. Webflow may stop any transaction, or take other actions as needed to restrict access to or availability of any Application that does not comply with this Agreement or that otherwise might adversely affect End Users.

5. **Review of Application**. To submit your Application to the Marketplace, you must complete an application, provide any additional information requested by Webflow and/or follow the instructions in the Marketplace Guidelines. At Webflow’s request, you will comply with its review process and provide Webflow with reasonably requested information, which Webflow will only use for purposes of such review. You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Webflow will be accurate and complete and that your Application will comply with the Marketplace Guidelines. If any Application information is inaccurate or needs to be updated or modified, you will promptly provide Webflow with corrections, updates, or modifications. Webflow may decide in its sole discretion whether to approve an Application in accordance with the Marketplace Guidelines. Developer remains solely responsible for its Application(s) and their quality, sufficiency, security, and support. In no event will you state or imply that Webflow endorses, sponsors, or guarantees your Application(s).

## 3\. **LICENSE TO WEBFLOW**

1. **Application License**. You hereby grant Webflow a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable right and license to: (i) to resell, distribute, or make available, as applicable, the Application through the Marketplace; and (ii) enable access to your Application on and through the Platform; and (iii) at Webflow’s sole discretion, feature your Application in the Marketplace.

Each Application submitted must be unique and substantially different; submitting multiple versions of the same Application as distinct applications is prohibited. Duplicate submissions intended to crowd out other developers or manipulate visibility within Webflow’s services are strictly forbidden.

Moreover, you may not create any derivative works of the Webflow Marks or use the Webflow Marks in a manner that creates or implies Webflow’s endorsement, sponsorship, or association of you or your Application. You will not otherwise use business names and/or logos in a manner that can mislead, confuse, or deceive individuals of your services or offerings. During the term of this Developer Agreement, Webflow may, in its sole discretion, grant you express permission to use the Webflow Marks in accordance with the usage requirements stated in this section in order to promote your Application(s).

07. **Webflow API Rate Limits.** You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls and use of the Webflow API (“ **Rate Limits**”), or otherwise use the Webflow API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise fails to comply or is inconsistent with any part of this Agreement. If you exceed or Webflow reasonably believes that you have attempted to circumvent Rate Limits, controls to limit use of the Webflow API, or the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then your ability to use the Webflow API or Platform (including the Marketplace) may be temporarily suspended or permanently blocked. Webflow may monitor your use of the Webflow API to improve the Webflow API and to ensure your compliance with this Agreement.

Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given (i) by Webflow via email and/or through the posting of such notice on your Webflow Dashboard, or (ii) by you via email to [legal@webflow.com](mailto:legal@webflow.com) or to such other email or physical addresses as Webflow may specify from time to time. The date of receipt will, in the case of email, be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

07. **Dispute Resolution; Governing Law; Venue.** To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to this Agreement, the parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute in good faith informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any legal proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. This Agreement is governed by and will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and the parties expressly consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.

08. **Entire agreement/severability.** This Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties regarding matters covered by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement supersedes and terminates any and all prior and/or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, otherwise relating to or concerning its subject matter or any previous Webflow partner programs or related offerings. Any and all waivers must be in writing and signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. Titles and headings of sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of any provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect.

09. **No waiver.** Any failure by Webflow to enforce or exercise any provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Webflow’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

10. **Attorneys’ and accountants’ fees; Remedies.** In any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys’ and accountants’ fees and costs. Developer agrees that Webflow’s remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Webflow shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Webflow may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees. No right or remedy of Webflow shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, and expenses. No instance of waiver by Webflow of its rights or remedies under this Agreement shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.
