As you prepare marketing materials for your Marketplace App, follow these helpful tips to create a clear and consistent experience for users.

## Talking about apps

As with most technical products, there is often a stark difference between how developers talk about a product compared to how it’s marketed and positioned to customers. Webflow Apps are no exception.

Most notably, while as a developer you are familiar with the inner workings of an App, customers see an App as a tool that helps them build their site. It’s recommended to use the following language when referring to your App in your marketing and educational materials:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Webflow App | A Webflow App is any product or service distributed via the Webflow Marketplace built using Webflow’s REST APIs via a Data Client, Designer APIs via a Designer Extension–or a combination of the two. |
| Webflow Marketplace | The Webflow Marketplace is where Webflow customers can find Apps, Libraries, Templates, Made in Webflow sites, and Certified Partners to assist them in building their site, business, or brand. |
| Apps Panel | A panel in the Webflow Designer, indicated by the Apps icon. When opened, customers can view and launch apps while editing their Webflow site. ![Apps icon](https://dhygzobemt712.cloudfront.net/Icons/Light/24px/Apps.png) |
| Launching an App | Once an App is installed on a Webflow site, a user can launch the App from the Apps Panel in the Designer. If you built an app using a Designer Extension, launching the App will open the App window in the Designer. If the App is built using only a Data Client, launching the App will take the user to the developer’s website. |
| App window | If you built an app using a Designer Extension, you can refer to the Designer Extension window as the App window, or simply the App. **Please do not refer to this panel as the Designer Extension, or Extension window in your user-facing materials.** |
| Webflow site | The main interface of Webflow’s product where customers can design, build and edit their sites. |

If your App interacts with specific capabilities in the Webflow product, use the [Webflow glossary](https://webflow.com/glossary) to make sure you are speaking about those features in a way that will resonate with the Webflow community.

## Brand and identity

### Using Webflow’s brand in app names and logos

Permission from Webflow, Inc. is required to use the Webflow name or logo as part of any:

- Project
- Product
- Service
- Domain name
- Company name

Permission may be granted for projects that:

- Advance Webflow’s platform and ecosystem
- Are non-commercial in nature

##### Domain names

Domain names containing “Webflow” are restricted to officially recognized Webflow communities only.

### Using Webflow’s brand in marketing materials

You can use the Webflow name and logo to describe your services, but not as part of your product, project, service, domain name, or company name. Don’t suggest any affiliation with or endorsement by Webflow.

**Acceptable use:**

- “123 Web Services, offering Webflow consulting”
- “XYZ Templates, featuring Webflow templates”
- Using the Webflow logo on pages describing your services

**Not acceptable:**

- “The Webflow Consulting Company”
- “The Webflow Template Portal”
- Using the Webflow logo in your company/product branding

##### Advertising

Webflow does not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

We do not want to limit commercial activity around Webflow. We encourage the growth of Webflow-based businesses, and thousands of them are thriving while complying with this policy, including our [Certified Webflow Partners](https://webflow.com/certified-partners). You can review [Webflow’s full trademark usage policy here](https://webflow.com/legal/trademark-policy).

### Using third-party brand identities in the Marketplace

Apps that integrate with third-party products (e.g. Google Analytics) require permission to use that product’s branding in your Marketplace listing name and logo.

You may list integrated products in your App description and features without permission. If you do not have the permission of the other product to use their trademarks and identity, your App listing will be denied during the review process.

## Promoting your Webflow App

Once your app is listed in the Marketplace, driving adoption and engagement is crucial for success. Here are some proven strategies to help grow your app’s user base:

### Build awareness and trust

- Create detailed documentation and getting started guides
- Showcase real customer success stories and use cases
- Maintain an active presence in the [Webflow Forum](https://forum.webflow.com/)
- Consider offering a free trial or freemium tier to let users experience value firsthand

### Drive ongoing engagement

- Send targeted onboarding emails to help users get maximum value
- Create video tutorials demonstrating key features and workflows
- Host regular office hours or live demos for users

### **App promotion by Webflow**

The Webflow Marketing Team will actively market Apps to customers in a number of ways. This includes, but may not be limited to:

- Posts on the Webflow blog
- Across Webflow’s social channels including Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok

Through email and lifecycle marketing to new and existing Webflow customers
- Digital ads
- Sales enablement training and content

While the promotion of individual Apps is at the discretion of the Webflow Team, we are always open to co-marketing ideas. If you have any thoughts to share, [please fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shr5eZvRuDx321HgV).

### Tracking traffic sources and attribution

We encourage Apps to use UTM parameters when directing traffic to app listings or to Webflow

This helps Webflow attribute traffic, installs, and user growth directly to your app, allowing us to better understand and support your success in the marketplace. See guidance on creating UTM parameters for source, medium, and campaign information below:

- **app-name** is the name of your app
- **medium** should be a clear description of the channel used, for example ‘website’ or ‘newsletter’ or ‘linkedin’
- **campaign** can be simply your app-name with -launch appended

| Destination | Source | Medium | Campaign | Full format |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your App listing | tech-partner | website | app-name-launch | `https://webflow.com/Apps/detail/App-name?utm_source=tech-partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=app-name-launch` |
| Webflow home page | tech-partner | website | app-name-launch | `https://webflow.com/?utm_source=tech-partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=app-name-launch` |
