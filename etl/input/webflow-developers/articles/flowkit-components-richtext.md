## Class Naming

The Rich Text component is used for long-form content such as blog posts, CMS fields, or documentation. It ensures consistent formatting of text elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and lists.

The base class is rich-text

This class is applied to the Webflow Rich Text element and styles all nested content inside it.

## Styling Behavior

All elements inside the Rich Text block—such as headings, paragraphs, links, and lists—are automatically styled using the same design tokens and variables as standalone components in the system.

This ensures visual consistency and centralized management of typography across both modular UI elements and content-driven blocks. As a result, any updates to global text styles will affect both the standalone components and Rich Text elements uniformly.
