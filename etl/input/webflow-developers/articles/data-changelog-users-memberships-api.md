## [Introducing Users APIs](https://developers.webflow.com/data/changelog/users-memberships-api)

## Users API

The Webflow Data API now supports five new APIs to list, manage, and invite users for the new Memberships feature (currently in Beta).

- **[List users](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/list)**
- **[Get user](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/get)**
- **[Invite user](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/invite)**
- **[Update user](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/update)**
- **[Delete user](https://developers.webflow.com/data/reference/users/users/delete)**

## Membership webhooks

The API now supports the `memberships_user_account_added` and `memberships_user_account_updated` webhook triggers.

## Developer site update

The developer site has been updated with improved syntax highlighting and examples for more languages. We’ve also moved OAuth into the main page and best of all - it’s now generated from an OpenAPI spec. Still a WIP and formatting improvements are constantly in the works.
