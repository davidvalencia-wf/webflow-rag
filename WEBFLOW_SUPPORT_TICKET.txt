Subject: Next.js 15 + TypeScript Deployment Fails - Template Type Error

Hi Webflow Cloud Support,

I'm unable to deploy Next.js 15 applications with TypeScript to Webflow Cloud due to a type error in Webflow's injected build template.

ISSUE:
Every build fails at TypeScript compilation with:

```
./next.config.ts:16:36
Type error: Property 'loaderFile' does not exist on type '{ unoptimized: boolean; }'.
```

This occurs in Webflow's injected template at line 63 of build logs:
"rendering override config from /cosmic/templates/nextjs/next.config.ts.template"

REPRODUCTION:
1. Create Next.js 15.0.3 app with TypeScript
2. Add next.config.ts file
3. Deploy to Webflow Cloud via GitHub
4. Build fails during type checking

EVIDENCE:
- Repo: https://github.com/ryanxkh/webflow-rag
- Failing commits: 849d349, f408d95 (all attempts since Nov 20)
- Build trace IDs: 6075855799555030659, 248841492879553055
- Local builds: Work perfectly
- Direct Cloudflare Pages deploy: Works (https://5f93cad7.webflow-rag.pages.dev)

CONFIGURATION:
- Next.js: 15.0.3
- React: 18.3.1
- @opennextjs/cloudflare: 1.6.5 (per your docs)
- TypeScript: 5.x (strict mode)

ROOT CAUSE:
Webflow's template references `images.loaderFile` which doesn't exist in Next.js 15's ImageConfig TypeScript types.

WORKAROUND:
Deployed directly to Cloudflare Pages successfully, bypassing Webflow Cloud's build system.

REQUEST:
1. Is Next.js 15 + TypeScript officially supported?
2. Can you update the template to be compatible with Next.js 15 types?
3. Timeline for fix?

Thank you,
